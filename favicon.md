Absolutely—you can create a proper `favicon.ico` yourself using Python and the Pillow library in just a few lines. Here's the minimalist way to do it:

### ✅ Step-by-step: Create `favicon.ico` in Python

#### 1. **Install Pillow** (if you haven’t already)

```bash
pip install pillow
```

#### 2. **Python Script**

```python
from PIL import Image

# Load your base image (preferably PNG, square, with transparency)
img = Image.open("your-image.png")

# Save as .ico with multiple sizes for best browser support
img.save("favicon.ico", format="ICO", sizes=[(16, 16), (32, 32), (48, 48), (64, 64), (128, 128), (256, 256)])
```

> 🔁 You can remove sizes you don’t need, but including multiple helps with scaling across platforms (e.g., browser tabs, bookmarks, Windows shortcuts).

#### 3. **Verify**

Make sure the output isn’t 0 bytes:

```bash
ls -lh favicon.ico
```

This method is fast, scriptable, and avoids web-based converters—perfect for projects like yours where symbolic fidelity and version control matter.

Want me to wrap this in a CLI-style script you can reuse in your project folder?
